# Project Overview
* Predicted what champion someone was playing out of 140 available champions in League of Legends based on ranked match data
* Assembled dataset with over 700,000 unique entires from over 70,000 ranked games using Riot Games API
* Engineered features like classifying whether a champion is AP/AD based on type of damage, and normalized continuous features by game duration
* Built ML pipeline and used Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Naive-Bayes, and Logistic Regression achieving 84% with Random Forest algorithm
* Performed cross-validation to ensure random forest was not overfitting achieving mean of 84% accuracy

### Assembling Dataset
* Used Riot's [LEAGUE-V4]([https://www.example.com](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis#league-v4)https://developer.riotgames.com/apis#league-v4)
