# Clustering League of Legends champions using PCA and K-means.
- League of Legends is an online 5v5 video game
- Players can choose from over 160+ characters (champions) to play
- Many players, especially new ones have a hard time figuring out who to play
- League of Legends provides a classification system for champions but it has many weaknesses
- Goal of project is to provide a new classification system through clustering, and provide more in-depth analysis into what makes each champion unique
